# Hello world! I'm Henrique ðŸ‘‹
## Little tiny bit about me:
I'm a fullstack developer and I've been programming for roughly a year now. I love sports, logic challenges, and to learn new languages (not just in programming).  
I know English, Spanish, Portuguese, and a bit of French.
## Main stacks:
React Native | React JS | NodeJS | MongoDB | MySQL | HTML | CSS | Javascript
## Favorite quote:
Not to sound like a Nike commercial but, 
*You miss 100% of the shots that you don't take, so take your shot!*
